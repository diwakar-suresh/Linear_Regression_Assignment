# Linear_Regression_Assignment

# Bike Sharing system
> Developing a model for the demand of shared bikes with the available independent variables so that this will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. This helps the management to manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations accordingly. Further, the model will also be a good way for the management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
- The company wants to know:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Approach: 
1. Data study and understanding 
2. EDA 
3. Data Preparation 
4. Data sanity check 
5. Linear model develpoment 
6. Model evaluation 
7. Assumptions verification 
8. R2 of Test dataset  


## Conclusions
- Linear regression model is developed based on the dataset


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0 
- Gitbash 
- Github 
- PPT
- Visual Studio Code
